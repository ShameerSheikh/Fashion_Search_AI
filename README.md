## Objectives: 
The main objective of this project is to develop a fashion query response system that utilizes AI models to provide detailed and user-friendly responses to fashion-related queries. The system aims to enhance user experience by generating informative and contextually relevant answers, thereby assisting users in finding fashion items based on their preferences. 

## Design: 
The project involves two main layers: the search layer and the generation layer. The search layer is responsible for retrieving relevant fashion items from the dataset based on keyword matching or predefined criteria. The generation layer utilizes advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 to generate detailed responses to user queries, incorporating context and generating natural language responses.
